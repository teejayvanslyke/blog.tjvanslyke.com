Its SaaS approach to invoicing makes it very attractive for backing up my critical financial data.  Their pricing is reasonable, too.|

I employ it because it understands and applies agile methodologies in a clean manner.  What's more, it's free and well-maintained.  If you're managing multiple projects and need a way to keep all of your project details in a well-organized dashboard, Pivotal will keep you and your clients happy.|

|*Water bottle*|If you like to ride to the far reaches of town for that cafe on the outskirts in the morning like I do, you'll want to stay hydrated.  Plus, water is good for your well-being, and will certainly make you more productive.|
|*Index cards*|Okay, so maybe I _do_ still write on real paper.  Sometimes the best way to think through a problem is to have a means of doodling.  I carry index cards in my backpack alongside my MacBook Pro.|
|*Long battery life*|I just bought one of the new MacBook Pros with the 7-8 hour battery (although it's actually more like 5-6 hours).  There's nothing more fufilling than sitting outside on a picnic table drinking coffee and earning your living doing it.  Stay mobile and bring the extra battery.|

That's how I manage my freelancing lifestyle.  What tools do you use to manage yours?
