title: Social networks on Rails

These days, everyone wants a social network.  I've received two RFP's only a few weeks apart from one another for custom social networking applications, and my fingers are quite tired of typing @has_many :friends, :class_name => 'User'@.  In order to allow me to rest my tired hands, I did a brief survey of the Rails-centric social networking solutions available.

Note that I cannot take full credit for my findings.  "This post on Stack Overflow":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/48320/best-ruby-on-rails-social-networking-framework was very helpful in my pursuit.

Without further ado, I present the three current big contenders:  "Lovd By Less":http://lovdbyless.com, "Insoshi":http://portal.insoshi.com, and "Community Engine":http://www.communityengine.org:

h4. Lovd By Less

Lovd By Less is the brainchild of "Less Everything":http://lesseverything.com.  It provides a baseline social networking application with support for friendships, advanced profile functionality, gravatars, user blogs, Flickr and YouTube integration, and more.  A look under the hood also reveals an impressively elegant permissions system with out-of-the-box support for extension via custom controllers.

Unfortunately, Lovd's status as a Rails application means it cannot be (easily) integrated into an existing application.

h4. Insoshi

Insoshi was created by the author of "RailsSpace":http://railsspace.com, a tutorial for creating Rails social networking applications.  It too is a standalone Rails application to serve as a starting point for your custom social networking site, so it isn't really a choice if you need to integrate social networking capabilities into your existing application.

Insoshi also has a dual license agreement.  Insoshi is licensed under the Affero GPL, so you'll need to distribute the source code to your users unless you cough up the commercial license fee.

h4. Community Engine

Community Engine takes a different approach to the social networking problem than Lovd or Insoshi.  Rather than provide a codebase from which you derive your application, Community Engine provides a Rails plugin which can even be integrated into existing applications.  

Despite this, I found Community Engine to be unnecessarily bloated for my purposes.  What's more, the plugin uses Test::Unit for its test suite.  I'm just partial to RSpec, I guess.

h4. The Verdict

If I had to make a recommendation, Lovd By Less would win out for sure.  It took me fewer than 10 minutes to set up a working social networking site, and only a few more minutes to add custom functionality.  Its commercial-friendly BSD license means you're free to use it to create the next MySpace (but please don't).
