title: Aggregate statistics for delayed_job with delayed_job_stats
---
I've recently found myself frustrated at the lack of immediate visibility with "delayed_job":http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job.  After hunting around online for an existing solution, I bit the bullet and created a plugin called "delayed_job_stats":http://github.com/teejayvanslyke/delayed_job_stats to provide me with some useful statistics about delayed_job via Rake and Capistrano:

{% highlight ruby %}
    Jobs remaining: 803
    Jobs run:       0
    Jobs failed:    0
    Workers:        1
{% endhighlight %}

Take a look at the README at the project's "GitHub repository":http://github.com/teejayvanslyke/delayed_job_stats for instructions.
