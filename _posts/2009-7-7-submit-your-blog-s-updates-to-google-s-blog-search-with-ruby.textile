title: Submit your blog's updates to Google's Blog Search with Ruby
---
A client needed to be able to submit blogs to "Google Blog Search's Ping Service":http://blogsearch.google.com/ping automatically from within a Rails application, so I decided I'd write a quick Ruby wrapper and make it available to all of you shiny people:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo gem sources -a "http://gems.github.com"
$ sudo gem install teejayvanslyke-google-blog-pinging-service 
{% endhighlight %}

The API is dead simple:

{% highlight ruby %}
GoogleBlogPingingService.ping("T.J. VanSlyke's Fantastic Blog", 
  "http://blog.tjvanslyke.com")
{% endhighlight %}

The @ping@ method will return @true@ if Google accepted your submission; @false@ otherwise.

Pull the source at the "GitHub repository":http://github.com/teejayvanslyke/google-blog-pinging-service/.
