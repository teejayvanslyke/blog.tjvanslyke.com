title: Never-ending Image Machine and Plotinus have been taken offline for now

I've taken these two experimental applications offline for the time being, since they were occupying a few too many megabytes of my server's memory.  

If you're interested in either of these projects and want to collaborate toward their production deployment, let me know and we'll discuss the possibilities.
