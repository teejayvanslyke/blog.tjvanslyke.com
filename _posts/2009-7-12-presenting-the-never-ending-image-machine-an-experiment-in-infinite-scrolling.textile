I've been up late the last couple nights working on another weird conceptual website.  This one's called the "Never-Ending Image Machine":http://neverendingimagemachine.tjvanslyke.com.  From its About page:

bq. the never-ending image machine's mission is to create the largest digital image ever created, one 128x128 square at a time. i want to create an online medium which restores a certain amount of mystique and chaos lost in indexed or tagged online experiences.

bq. there are no rules for submission, but you're encouraged to craft your submissions such that they connect with others'. 

I encourage you artsy types to contribute and give feedback!
